# School District Analysis
## Overview of Project
* The purpose of this project was to analyze the Math and Reading scores of students in this school district, to help inform school district budgets for next year. 
* I looked at the data to see how many students were passing math, reading or both, by school, by grade, by type of school, and by per capita spending.  
* It was then found that the 9th grade scores for one of the schools in the dataset were void, so I then completed the same analysis again with those scored voided out and compared my results
