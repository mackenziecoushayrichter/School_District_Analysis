# School District Analysis
## Overview of Project
* The purpose of this project was to analyze the Math and Reading scores of students in this school district, to help inform school district budgets for next year. 
* I looked at the data to see how many students were passing math, reading or both, by school, by grade, by type of school, and by per capita spending.  
* It was then found that the 9th grade scores for one of the schools in the dataset were void, so I then completed the same analysis again with those scored voided out and compared my results
# Results
## District Summary
* Once the Math and Reading scores for the 9th graders at Thomas High School were replace with "NaN" values ("not a number"), I compared the District Summary before and after.
* These scores did not make much of an impact on the district's overall statistics.  
* Total Schools, Total Students, and Total Budget, Average Reading Score stayed the same.
* The only changes were:
  * The Average Math Score dropped slighty from 79.0 to 78.9
  * The % of Students Passing Math dropped slighty from 75.0 t0 74.8
  * The % of Students Passing Reading dropped slighty from 85.8 to 85.7
  * The % of Students Passing Overall dropped slighty from 65.2 to 64.9
* Below is an image of the district summary after the 9th grade scores in question were replaced.
